			<h3>"In My Life"</h3>
		</header>
			<p>There are places I remember</p>
			<p>All my life though some have changed</p>
			<p>Some forever not for better</p>
			<p>Some have gone and some remain</p>
			<p>All these places have their moments</p>
			<p>With lovers and friends I still can recall</p>
			<p>Some are dead and some are living</p>
			<p>In my life I've loved them all</p>
			<br>	
			<p>But of all these friends and lovers</p>
			<p>There is no one compares with you</p>
			<p>And these memories lose their meaning</p>
			<p>When I think of love as something new</p>
			<p>Though I know I'll never lose affection</p>
			<p>For people and things that went before</p>
			<p>I know I'll often stop and think about them</p>
			<p>In my life I love you more</p>
			<br>
			<p>Though I know I'll never lose affection</p>
			<p>For people and things that went before</p>
			<p>I know I'll often stop and think about them</p>
			<p>In my life I love you more</p>
			<br>
			<p>In my life I love you more</p>
